# MY DAILY PAPER TRADING ROUTINE

Every evening at 6 PM:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run these commands:

   cd ~/Desktop/AlgoBot_Project/paper_trading
   python3.11 run_daily.py

3. Read the output (takes 30 seconds to run)
4. Update journal with emotions/thoughts
5. Done! (Total time: 2 minutes)

THAT'S IT! The bot does everything else.

DO NOT:
❌ Manually buy/sell
❌ Change parameters mid-strategy
❌ Skip days (consistency matters)
❌ Panic on losses (system is designed for 45% win rate)

DO:
✅ Run script daily
✅ Journal emotions honestly
✅ Trust the process
✅ Be patient

After 60 days (Dec 24, 2025):
Review results and decide on live trading.
